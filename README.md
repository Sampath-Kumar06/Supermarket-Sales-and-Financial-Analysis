# Supermarket Sales and Finance Analysis Dashboard 

This repository contains the data and assets for a comprehensive analysis of supermarket sales and financial performance. The core goal of this project is to transform raw transaction data into actionable business intelligence using an interactive dashboard.

## What I'm Doing in the Dashboard: Key Analysis

The dashboard provides an in-depth view of the supermarket's operations, focusing on profitability, efficiency, and customer behavior. The analysis is built upon the **Supermarket_Sales_Finance_Analysis.csv** dataset and covers the following key areas:

### üí∞ Financial and Sales Performance
* **Total Revenue & Profitability:** Tracking **Total Sales** and **Gross Income** to measure overall financial health.
* **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Monitoring COGS to understand the true cost of sales.
* **Branch Performance:** Benchmarking sales and gross income across different **Branches** and **Cities** (e.g., Yangon, Naypyitaw, Mandalay) to identify top performers and areas needing improvement.

### üõç Product and Customer Insights
* **Product Line Analysis:** Identifying the most popular and profitable **Product Lines** (e.g., Food and beverages, Electronic accessories, Home and lifestyle) based on quantity sold and gross income contribution.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Analyzing sales and spending habits by **Customer Type** (Member vs. Normal) and **Gender**.
* **Payment Preferences:** Visualizing the distribution of sales across different **Payment** methods (Cash, Ewallet, Credit Card).
* **Customer Satisfaction:** Reviewing the average **Rating** metric to assess customer experience.
